## Clothes inventory
This feature allows users to create a detailed inventory of their wardrobe. Users can input information such as size, color, type, brand, material, purchase date, and price for each piece of clothing they own. This helps users manage and categorize their wardrobe efficiently, making it easy to search, sort, and filter items by different criteria. It will also include image uploads for each item if the user want to have a visual wardrobe experience.

## Log outfit each day
Users can log their daily outfits by selecting the clothing items they wore each day from their wardrobe inventory. Users can also add custom notes about the occasion, weather, or mood to provide context for the outfit. This feature will allow users to track their style choices over time, save favorite outfits for future reference, and analyze their outfit patterns. In the future, this data can be used for outfit recommendations, enabling the app to suggest combinations based on past trends and underutilized items.

## Statistic on clothing worn
The statistics dashboard will provide users with visual insights into their wardrobe usage. It will display metrics such as:
- Most-worn clothing items
- Least-worn or never-worn items
- Cost-per-wear for each item (calculated by dividing the price by the number of times it has been worn)
- Wear frequency by category (e.g., tops, bottoms, shoes)
- 
Users can also set personal goals, such as reducing the cost-per-wear of certain items or redistributing the use of their wardrobe more evenly. The dashboard can suggest decluttering or donating rarely worn items to encourage more mindful consumption.

## Outfit recommendation 
This feature uses data from the userâ€™s past outfit logs and wardrobe inventory to suggest new outfits. It will take into account the user's favorite combinations and the clothing items that have not been worn recently. The system could also use filters like weather, season, or occasion to refine outfit suggestions.
