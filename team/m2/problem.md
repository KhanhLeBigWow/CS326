# Problem Statement

## Problem Description

Many people struggle to manage their wardrobes effectively, resulting in cluttered closets, unworn clothes, and impulse purchases. Without clear visibility into how often they wear certain items, people may buy similar pieces or lose track of what they own, leading to wasted money and underutilized clothing. Existing solutions, such as organizing apps or manual methods like spreadsheets often lack key features such as outfit tracking or offering meaningful insights about personal clothing habits.

## Proposed Solution

**ClosetIQ** is a web application that helps users catalog their clothes, log daily outfits, and gain insights into their wearing habits. With features like wardrobe inventory tracking, outfit logging, and visual wear statistics, ClosetIQ enables users to identify underutilized pieces and make more conscious clothing decisions.

- **Wardrobe Inventory**: Users can enter and categorize the items in their wardrobe, including details such as color, style, and season.
- **Outfit Logging**: Daily outfits can be logged, allowing users to track how often specific pieces are worn.
- **Wear Statistics**: Real-time charts and graphs offer insights into wearing habits, such as the most and least worn items, seasonal trends, and cost-per-wear analysis.

By combining ease of use with advanced features, ClosetIQ empowers users to become more intentional about their clothing consumption and make better financial decisions.

## Why This Matters

In an age of fast fashion, people often accumulate more clothing than they need, leading to clutter, wasted money, and environmental harm. **ClosetIQ** encourages users to be more mindful of their wardrobe habits, promoting conscious consumption, organization, and sustainability. This tool is ideal for anyone looking to simplify their wardrobe, reduce waste, and save money.
