# Problem Statement

## Problem Description

Many people struggle to manage their wardrobes effectively, resulting in cluttered closets, unworn clothes, and impulse purchases. Without clear visibility into how often they wear certain items, people tend to buy similar pieces or lose track of what they own, leading to wasted money and underutilized clothing. Existing solutions, such as organizing apps or manual methods like spreadsheets often lack key features such as daily outfit tracking or offering meaningful insights and statistics about personal clothing habits.

## Proposed Solution

**ClosetIQ** is a web application that helps users easily manage their wardrobes. ClosetIQ offers users the ability to intuitively catalog their clothes into a virtual wardrobe, log daily outfits, and gain insights into their wearing habits. Users will have access to automatically updating charts and graphs that provide visualization into existing clothing habits and patterns, allowing them to identify underutilized pieces and make more conscious clothing decisions.

Key features include:

- **Wardrobe Inventory**: Users can enter and categorize the items in their wardrobe, including details such as type, cost, color, style, and season.
- **Outfit Logging**: Daily outfits can be logged, allowing users to track how often specific pieces are worn.
- **Wear Statistics**: Real-time charts and graphs offer insights into wearing habits, such as the most and least worn items, seasonal trends, and cost-per-wear analysis.

By combining ease of use with advanced visualization features, ClosetIQ empowers users to become more intentional about their clothing consumption and make better financial decisions.

## Why This Matters

In an age of fast fashion, people often accumulate more clothing than they need, leading to cluttered closets, increased stress, and wasted money. This overconsumption also causes environmental harm as it plays a significant role in the 92 million tons of textile waste each year. ClosetIQ encourages users to be more mindful of their wardrobe habits, promoting conscious consumption, organization, and sustainability. This tool is ideal for anyone looking to simplify their wardrobe, reduce waste, and have better financial judgment about their clothing consumption.
